<!-- <p style="text-align: justify;">
  I received my Bachelor of Science degree in Electrical Engineering from National Taiwan University in June 2024. Currently, I am working as a research assistant at <a href="https://www.iis.sinica.edu.tw/en/index.html" >Academia Sinica</a>, Taiwan’s national academic institution, under the guidance of <a href="https://homepage.iis.sinica.edu.tw/pages/dyhong/index_en.html" >Dr. Ding-Yong Hong</a> and <a href="https://homepage.iis.sinica.edu.tw/pages/wuj/index_en.html" >Dr. Jan-Jan Wu</a>. I have had the privilege of interning at <a href="https://research.ibm.com/labs/almaden" >IBM Research Almaden</a>, where I was mentored by <a href="https://research.ibm.com/people/geoffrey-burr" >Dr. Geoffrey Burr</a> and <a href="https://research.ibm.com/people/sidney-tsai" >Dr. Hsin-Yu (Sidney) Tsai</a>, and working as an undergraduate researcher at <a href="https://access.ee.ntu.edu.tw/" >NTU Access Lab</a>, advised by <a href="https://www.ee.ntu.edu.tw/profile1.php?id=65" >Prof. An-Yeu (Andy) Wu</a>.

<p style="text-align: justify;">
My research focuses on <strong>hardware/software co-design for AI accelerators, particularly in Computing-In-Memory (CIM) circuits and multicore inference accelerators.</strong> My work includes CIM architecture design, CIM-aware quantization, algorithms for dynamic resource allocation on multicore accelerators, and full-stack accelerator design for N:M structured pruning. I am also experienced in and interested in <strong>digital VLSI system design.</strong> I like to design new stuff and test unconventional ideas. In my free time, I like to play Go, basketball, and badminton.

Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.
