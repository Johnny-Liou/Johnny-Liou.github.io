abstract: "Massive activation spikes in Large Language Models (LLMs) severely degrade quantization by stretching dynamic ranges. While prior hypotheses characterize these as high-level scalar biases, we argue that they are merely the scalar intermediates of rigid, structural vector biases in the spike-carrying tokens. We show that these tokens converge to constant vectors after normalization that drive the attention sink and value-state drain mechanisms. We geometrically substantiate this by analyzing the coordination of projection weights: $W_K$ contrastively amplifies the vector, $W_Q$ aligns semantic tokens toward it, and $W_V$ projects it into the spectral null-space. Furthermore, we reveal that the model actively preserves these structural biases against Rotary Positional Embedding (RoPE) perturbations by localizing them in zones of rotational stability utilizing low-frequency bands and coherent channel pairs. Leveraging this, we propose INSERTQUANT, a post-training quantization (PTQ) framework that clamps spikes and restores their function via pre-computed template vectors."
